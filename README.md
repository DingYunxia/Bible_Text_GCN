# Graph Convolutional Network for Bible book classification

The Holy Bible consists of 66 Books (Genesis, Exodus, etc) and 1189 Chapters. The goal here is to train a language model that is able to classify the Book that a Chapter belongs to.

Implementation follows the paper on Text-based Graph Convolutional Network (https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05679)
